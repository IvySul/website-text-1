<body>
  <p>The feeling that I'm losing <span style="color:hotpink;">her</span> forever....</p>
  <p>And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl</p>
<p><b>Slipping</b> through my fingers all the t&nbsp;i&nbsp;m&nbsp;e&nbsp;<p>
<p>I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, <em>slipping<em> through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time...<p>
